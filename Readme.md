# PC Setup Script 

This script automates installation and configuration of software on a fresh PC with an emphasis on .NET fullstack development.

## Configuration file
The script requires a configuration file called `config.psd1`. This is a sample of this file:

```
@{
    GitUserName  = "Your Name"
    GitUserEmail = "Your@Email.com"
}
```
